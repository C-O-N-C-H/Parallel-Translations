# Parallel Translations for Indigenous Languages

This repository is dedicated to the creation and development of parallel translations for various texts across a wide range of languages, including **Dutch, Portuguese, French, Spanish, English**, and several **Indigenous languages** such as **Lokono, Wayuu, and Garifuna**. Our goal is to build a valuable resource that can support Indigenous communities, facilitate language preservation, and assist in linguistic research.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a collection of texts translated in parallel across multiple languages, with a particular emphasis on Indigenous languages. These translations are intended to:

- Increase accessibility and intercultural understanding.
- Preserve Indigenous languages.
- Facilitate their use in daily communication and academic research.

In addition to widely spoken languages (Dutch, Portuguese, French, Spanish, and English), this project prioritizes the inclusion of Indigenous languages such as Lokono, Wayuu, and Garifuna, which often face challenges like language loss and a scarcity of digital resources.

## Languages Included

The following languages are currently part of our parallel translations:

- Dutch
- Portuguese
- French
- Spanish
- English
- Lokono
- Wayuu
- Garifuna

## Project Purpose

The main objectives of this repository are:

- **Support for Indigenous Languages:** Provide a digital resource for Indigenous communities that helps maintain their languages through the translation of relevant texts. This can be useful in education, local governance, and cultural preservation.
- **Facilitate Research:** Offer a foundation for linguists, researchers, and educators working on Indigenous language revitalization. The parallel translation setup allows for comparative studies and a deeper understanding of linguistic structures.
- **Cultural Exchange:** Foster cross-cultural communication and understanding by making texts available in both widely spoken and Indigenous languages.
- **Empower Indigenous Communities:** Help bridge communication gaps by making important resources more accessible to communities that speak Indigenous languages.
## How to Contribute
