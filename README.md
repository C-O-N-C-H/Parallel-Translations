Parallel Translations for Indigenous Languages

This repository is dedicated to the creation and development of parallel translations for various texts in a wide range of languages, including Dutch, Portuguese, French, Spanish, English, and several indigenous languages such as Lokono, Wayuu, and Garifuna. The goal is to build a valuable resource that can support indigenous communities, facilitate language preservation, and assist with research in these languages.

Project Overview

This project seeks to create a collection of texts translated in parallel across multiple languages, with a particular emphasis on indigenous languages. The translations aim to increase accessibility and understanding between cultures, preserve indigenous languages, and facilitate their use in everyday communication as well as academic research.

In addition to the widely spoken languages (Dutch, Portuguese, French, Spanish, and English), this project prioritizes the inclusion of indigenous languages, such as Lokono, Wayuu, and Garifuna, which may face challenges of language loss and limited digital resources.

Languages Included

The following languages are currently part of the parallel translations:

Dutch
Portuguese
French
Spanish
English
Lokono
Wayuu
Garifuna
Purpose

Indigenous Language Support: Provide a digital resource for indigenous communities that helps maintain their languages through the translation of common texts. This could be useful in education, local governance, and cultural preservation.
Facilitate Research: Offer a foundation for linguists, researchers, and educators working on indigenous language revitalization. The parallel translation setup allows for comparative studies and deeper understanding of language structures.
Cultural Exchange: Foster cross-cultural communication and understanding by making texts available in both widely spoken and indigenous languages.
Support Indigenous Communities: Help bridge communication gaps by making important resources more accessible to communities who speak indigenous languages.
How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from individuals and groups who are interested in supporting indigenous languages and cultures. Here's how you can help:

Translation Contributions: If you are fluent in any of the languages involved (especially indigenous languages), you can help by contributing additional translations or improving existing ones.
Proofreading: Help ensure the quality of translations by reviewing and editing content.
Text Suggestions: Suggest texts for translation that might be valuable to indigenous communities or researchers.
Technical Support: If you have suggestions for improving the structure or functionality of this repository (e.g., adding tools for easier access or display), feel free to contribute.
